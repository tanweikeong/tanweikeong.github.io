We have so many digital photos at our fingertips that we forget all the old printed photos we still have at home, stuffed in drawers and slowly fading. Digitising your old photos preserves them for future generations and makes it easier for you to share them with friends and family.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"one_third\">\n<div>\n<p>Singapore Snaps is a relational art project that focuses on the public&#8217;s collective memories of Singapore.<\/p>\n<p>We want to preserve your memories by providing free digitised copies of your old printed photos. Using selected photographs, we create animation works according to themes commonly found within the archive. These works will be screened as part of the events for Singapore&#8217;s 50th anniversary of independence in 2015.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"one_third last\">\n<p>Join us on our journey to preserve memories through the process of digitising, and to collect stories from the photo Contributors, in turn allowing our project to uncover the thread that weaves the unseen fabric of themes that hold us together, as an individual and as a unit of society, through time.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"clearboth\"><\/div>\n[\/spb_text_block] [blank_spacer height=&#8221;60px&#8221; width=&#8221;1\/1&#8243; el_position=&#8221;first last&#8221;] [spb_text_block title=&#8221;Planning&#8221; pb_margin_bottom=&#8221;no&#8221; pb_border_bottom=&#8221;no&#8221; width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243; el_position=&#8221;first&#8221;]\n<p>Besides the national and participating public libraries mentioned above, the project works with partners who would like to connect with, and actively engage the public community through this project.
