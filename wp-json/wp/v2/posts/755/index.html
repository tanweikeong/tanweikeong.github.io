Although she was 92 years old then, a deceased woman is granted three more years to her age, according to tradition. Therefore her death age was declared as 95 instead.<\/p>\n<p>The great-grandmother was the oldest elder in the Jalan Kayu village. She lived through five generations. For the wake, my husband and his siblings were dressed in green &#8220;xiao fu&#8221; (\u5b5d\u670d), which literally means \u201cfilial clothes\u201d, with pink overlays. The youngest member was just four years old then.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_760\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Teo-Yap-Tee-Hearse-in-the-traffic.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-760\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-760  \" title=\"Hearse in the traffic\" src=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Teo-Yap-Tee-Hearse-in-the-traffic-1024x718.jpg\" alt=\"In the traffic.

The funeral procession was done in Hokkien-Taoist tradition. Besides serving dinners, my husband remembered that they had to order a truckload of \u201cGreen Spot\u201d, a brand of soft drinks, to be given out to people who showed up to pay their respects.
