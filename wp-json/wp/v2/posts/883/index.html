Before we were born, or could develop a conscious memory of the world, the theater also known as the &#8220;People&#8217;s Theatre&#8221; was already demolished in the mid-1986. That was when the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) North East line to connect Chinatown to Dhoby Ghaut and the Central Expressway (CTE) began construction and the theatre had to make way for these developments. Our only encounters with this theatre were through the collected photographs and conversations with the contributors, and we certainly saw and felt the glory and splendour the theatre exuded that remained in the hearts of Singaporeans.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_892\" style=\"width: 747px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/012_4893.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-892\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-892\" src=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/012_4893-737x1024.jpg\" alt=\"The theatre, a common spot for family outings.

The center of the theatre\u2019s outdoor fountain is a crescent moon sculpture representing the crescent moon on our flag.

These two events placed Singapore amongst the other newly formed independent nations in Southeast Asia.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_897\" style=\"width: 552px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Koh-Eng-Soon_Postage.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-897\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-897\" src=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Koh-Eng-Soon_Postage.jpg\" alt=\"Commemorative stamp for the South-east Asia Cultural Festival posted on the opening day, 8th of August 1983.

From the book &#8220;Our Collective Memory&#8221; by Koh Eng Soon.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The inaugural show at the National Theatre reflected just that. The Southeast Asian Cultural Festival was launched to celebrate the opening of the theatre on August 8 1963. Eleven Asian countries attended this grand opening, including film stars from Hong Kong. A postage stamp of a value of 5 cents was specially released to commemorate the event. There were performances of folk dances from around the region. In the opening, our first president, Yusof bin Ishak described the festivities as a \u201cSouth-East Asian cultural renaissance.\u201d It seems that this interest of a bourgeoning cultural scene in South East Asia is not a recent construction but one that has its roots way before our nation\u2019s independence in 1965.<\/p>\n<p>The National Theatre was also the result of one of Singapore\u2019s first major crowd-sourcing project \u2013 \u201cA-dollar-a-brick\u201d campaign, in which the public could buy a $1 paper brick, a colour-printed frame showing a design of the National Theatre. This fund-raising campaign supplemented the government for the building costs, and described by the then Minister of Culture, S. Rajaratnam as \u201ca good example of how the success of any effort depends ultimately on the co-operation and dedication of people from all walks of life.&#8221; The theatre also became an emblem of community-building, earning its civic name of the &#8220;People&#8217;s Theatre&#8221;.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_898\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/234_05276.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-898\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-898\" src=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/234_05276-1024x775.jpg\" alt=\"Buses parked infront of the theatre to charter students for their performances.

Aside from its massive 3,420 seating capacity, it is also a reminder of our beginnings as a nation.

Photo credit: Seow Shin Horng<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Now, close to the original site of the National Theatre of Singapore, stands an artwork by Architectural historian Lai Chee Kien for the Singapore Biennale in 2013. In exactly 50 years since its construction, the sculpture is a reminder of the theatre\u2019s existence, possibly unknown to many Singaporean youths. The 40m-tall painted steel sculpture of the theatre\u2019s fa\u00e7ade pales in terms of scale compared to the original size, but it makes an excellent backdrop for photographs as a tribute to the ones taken when the theatre was still around.<\/p>\n<p>There is a situational irony literally behind the sculpture. The vacant space of what used to be the area where cultural celebrations were held is now empty. What is left is but an empty plot of grass with trees meagrely occupying the space. Is this current state of the site a reflection of how our country, in its race for progress, has emptied out any semblance of a true aspiration to culturally define ourselves? Only to be left with an empty shell to remind us of its ghost? Only one can ponder, looking at the smiles of the people in the photographs of the theatre from before.<\/p>\n<p>Written by Samantha Tio<br \/>\nEdited by Tan Wei Keong<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Scan-2.jpeg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-895\" src=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Scan-2.jpeg\" alt=\"Scan 2\" width=\"200\" height=\"251\" \/><\/a>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Scan-1.jpeg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-896\" src=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Scan-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Scan 1\" width=\"204\" height=\"257\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Scan-1.jpeg 509w, https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Scan-1-237x300.jpeg 237w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Singapore Snaps would like to show our great appreciation and admiration to the work of Mr Koh Eng Soon, author of \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u8bb0\u5fc6\u201d (Our Collective Memory) \u2013 A self-published book, in Mandarin, on the National Theatre of Singapore and several other historical landmarks.
