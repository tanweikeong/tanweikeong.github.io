Visitors would sit in a flume that meanders past \u201cmountains\u201d and through \u201crivers\u201d, climaxing at a huge drop at the end where the flume finally splashes into a pool of water. What&#8217;s also unforgettable is the amphitheater which hosts regular performances of mystical Chinese legends adapted into English. \u201cThe play was about mother-earth and her children of the different elements. They tried to find harmony with each other for peace in the universe,\u201d the four-year-old me noted in my journal. I could still remember running down the theatre stairs, trying to steal a touch of the performers&#8217; costume.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1017\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/002.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1017\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-1017\" src=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/002-1024x735.jpg\" alt=\"Photo credit: Rohani Bte Din\" width=\"590\" height=\"423\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/002-1024x735.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/002-300x215.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/002-1280x919.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-1017\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Rohani Bte Din<\/p><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Still vivid in my mind was also the long queue for visitors to have their photographs taken dressed in fancy ancient Chinese costumes. I pestered my mother to let me have a photo taken in a princess costume. My frugal mother found two-dollars too costly during that time, and a staged photograph was too impractical for keep-sake. \u201cIt would be better if we took the photographs ourselves,\u201d she responded. I agreed and left Haw Par Villa more than satisfied. Who knew more than twenty-four years later, my mother\u2019s words proved right! As we took out photographs from my family photo album for Singapore Snaps, wonderful memories of my childhood came pouring back.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1014\" style=\"width: 595px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/0056.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1014\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-1014\" src=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/0056-1024x641.jpg\" alt=\"Photo credit: Wong Meng\" width=\"585\" height=\"366\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/0056-1024x641.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/0056-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/0056-1280x802.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-1014\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Wong Meng<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Like a wild card, the Singapore Snaps team had found hundreds of photographs that other families took at Haw Par Villa over the years.

It highlights the bizarre and gruesomeness of the subjects depicted by the dioramas. A lot of which, are taken out of context. In reference to the sculpture where a young lady is breast-feeding an elderly, through unknowing eyes it might look shockingly pornographic. But what was meant to be conveyed through this act is filial piety. In medicine scarcity situations, breast milk has nutrients which strengthen the immune system, and for the young to provide this to the elderly is a commendable act of filial piety. Of course, filial piety means different matters in this day and age, and between the Eastern and Western cultures. But what needs to be highlighted is that these images sit in large and complex discourse of Chinese, or even more specifically diasporic Chinese, beliefs. Beyond being artefacts to gawk at, Haw Par Villa is an expression of a desire to impart values.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1015\" style=\"width: 538px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/0061.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1015\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-1015\" src=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/0061-740x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Photo credit: Stephanie Chan\" width=\"528\" height=\"731\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/0061-740x1024.jpg 740w, https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/0061-216x300.jpg 216w, https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/0061-1280x1770.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-1015\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Stephanie Chan<\/p><\/div>\n<p>In the personal histories of its creators Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par, Haw Par Villa is also a manifestation of love and brotherhood. It is apt that the park\u2019s program is currently under the custody of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.latentspaces.com\/\">Latent Spaces<\/a>, a contemporary art group fronted by twin brothers, Chun Kai Qun and Chun Kai Feng. Can Haw Par Villa continue to give new meaning to Singaporeans and its visitors beyond its histories?
