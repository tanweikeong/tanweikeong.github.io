With the involvement of student volunteers, the project connects the residents with students of a younger generation, and engage meaningful conversations about personal histories and memories.<\/p>\n<p>For the past three weeks, we have been collecting photographs from the residents, who we got to know better by talking to them about their memories, of a moment in time of the stories they captured with their photographs. Students from Hwa Chong Institute and Hougang Secondary School, as well as friends who participated in this journey, have been making their rounds together in the Toa Payoh neighbourhood. The photographs and stories they collected are nothing short of intriguing, informing and in fact, unexpected.<\/p>\n<p>Student volunteers arrive in the afternoons after school, or on weekends to visit the neighbourhood either in pairs, or in small groups. Prior to heading out, they are briefed on their introduction of themselves and the project to the residents, and having positive attitudes throughout the visit. Should a resident be interested in learning more about the project, and in the event that the resident wishes to participate, volunteers may be invited into the resident&#8217;s home. While accepting the photo contributions, volunteers are encouraged to be curious and inquisitive so Contributors are encouraged to share their personal stories in relation to the photographs at hand.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_459\" style=\"width: 658px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/IMG_2948.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-459\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-459  \" src=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/IMG_2948.jpg\" alt=\"The student volunteer team from Singapore Snaps taking part in a slightly uncommon volunteering endeavour.\" width=\"648\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/IMG_2948.jpg 1800w, https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/IMG_2948-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/IMG_2948-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/IMG_2948-1280x853.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-459\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The student volunteer team from Singapore Snaps taking part in a slightly uncommon volunteering endeavour.<\/p><\/div>\n<div id=\"attachment_461\" style=\"width: 658px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/IMG_2961.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-461\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-461  \" src=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/IMG_2961.jpg\" alt=\"The corridors of our HDBs may look similar, but each home holds stories waiting to be discovered - These are the stories our volunteers get access to when a willing resident opens the doors to let them in.\" width=\"648\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/IMG_2961.jpg 1800w, https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/IMG_2961-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/IMG_2961-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/sgsnaps.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/IMG_2961-1280x853.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-461\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The corridors of our HDBs may look similar, but each home holds stories waiting to be discovered &#8211; These are the stories our volunteers get access to when a willing resident opens the doors to let them in.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>When a Contributor submits his or her photographs, we take great care in ensuring that the photographs are kept in its original condition until they are returned.
