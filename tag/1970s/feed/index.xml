										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People take photographs for various reasons &#8211; as a way to remember events, as a creative expression, and with the rise in popularity of smartphones, as a form of communication between friends and loved ones. Angela Kuet, with her three siblings, grew up at her father&#8217;s photo studio and to them, photography is family. Her father, Kuet Gin Bok, set up the &#8220;New City Photo Studio (新市影室)&#8221; from 1958 &#8211; 1987. The shop was located at Changi Road 五条半石 which, in Mandarin, means 5 miles and a half from the city centre.</p>
<div id="attachment_1143" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/new_city_photo_studio_web2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1143" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" class="size-large wp-image-1143" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/new_city_photo_studio_web2-1024x776.jpg" alt="The various facades of the studio in the 1960s and 1970s.

Bottom left: Firecrackers were used to celebrate the 9th anniversary of the studio.</p></div>
<p>The busiest time every year at the studio was always immediately after the Chinese New Year celebration, when an increase in photo print requests meant working into the wee hours at the photo studio for the Keuk family. After the doors closed at 9pm, Gin Bok would enter the dark room to develop films and prints. The dark room is perpetually humid. And with chemical solutions and water running continuously, Angela worried for her father&#8217;s rheumatism. His fingers were stained brown from the chemical solutions, which are mixtures of powder formula and water of right proportions. Films and prints are meticulously soaked in these solutions, before running through with clear water.</p>
<p>Angela remembered him to be an extremely hardworking father, who would work long hours to provide for his family of six. Despite his busy schedule, Gin Bok insisted driving the children to their school. There were times when he was delayed in the studio, which meant teary eyes for the children who had to wait patiently at the school gates for their father to fetch them.</p>

<p>Gin Bok voluntarily took photos for the neighbours and friends, including the kacang putih seller, who sells Indian snacks typically made of nuts and spices. He was well-liked by his customers due to his photography skills and eloquence, and thus the studio was the meeting point of friends and relatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Life was simpler,&#8221; said Angela of the good memories growing up at the photo studio. Floods were common and water would overflow into the shop space. The family would prop the equipment up on tables and stilts to keep them dry. Together with her elder sister and two younger brothers, she remembered each day filled with tasks with for the family business, like drying the photos in a giant air dryer and cutting the photo borders away to the correct sizes. The studio closes on Fridays.</p>

<p>Angela says of her childhood growing up with her siblings, &#8220;We were so fortunate that my father used to take us out for activities on Fridays or school holidays. We went swimming at the Changi seaside, visited and took photos at popular sites like the Queen Elizabeth Walk, Botanic Gardens, Fort Canning Hill, National Theatre,Van Kleef Aquarium, Mount Faber and Katong Park. We also visited our maternal grandmother at her coffee shop. Sometimes after the studio closed at 9pm, we would follow my father to send some photos for framing, colouring (for the black and white photos) or to send the clients&#8217; cameras for repair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before digital &#8216;photoshop&#8217;, workers used sharpened lead to edit films and touch up prints using manual techniques. There were also times when newly weds would form long queues outside the photo studio for their wedding portraits to be taken. Photographs were almost always of happy occasions.</p>
<p>After retiring his photo studio business in 1987, Gin Bok turned to chinese calligraphy, a form of art he had been practising in the 1980s. Impressed and awed by his beautiful calligraphy, his studio clients would ask for his work, in forms of festive couplets and even writing requests.</p>

<p>Gin Bok passed away in May 2014. He had left behind a huge collection of diaries which he had been writing continuously over his lifetime. Writings, like photographs, are moments captured of a certain past. In a way, that moment has &#8216;died&#8217; because it does not belong to the present. The act of reading, or looking at these photographs however, transports the viewer back to these times which are considered important to the writer or photographer. For a moment, albeit temporarily, the viewer re-lives in that moment and he/she gained an experience and understanding why that moment in time is so important to the writer/photographer. It might take a while for Angela before she has the courage to read and re-live those diaries her father left behind. When she did, she will realise that they are reminders of how her father talks, moves and thinks. These moments are constantly living and it is an entry to his understanding of the world.</p>
<p>The shop of &#8216;New City Photo Studio&#8217; is currently an eatery specialising in black chicken tonic soup, owned by an old neighbour who knew the Kuet family for a long time while working nearby the shop as a stall assistant. Angela&#8217;s daughter is now a photographer, whose interest started after receiving her grandfather&#8217;s Leica camera on one of her birthdays.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Water has been a significant influence on Singapore’s history in commerce, historical and social settings that interweave with the lives of Singaporeans. As the country progresses and one&#8217;s preoccupation with the city becomes entrenched, city-dwellers tend to forget that we are living on an island surrounded by water. Like gazing into vast skies, seas and lakes are places we pause and reflect on our lives. Thus today, Singapore Snaps would like to slow our pace and take a breather with our readers by sharing images that evoke carefree memories of moments that we enjoyed with our friends and families, playing by the water.</p>
<p>Top photo: After a day of play, Meng Wong captured the delight of friends sharing hot satay right off the charcoal grill, and ketupat (hanging on the horizontal pole), both signature Malay food in Singapore. Photo: Meng Wong</p>
<p>Be it an excursion with primary classmates or family weekend outing, a good number of us would have spent some warm, sunny afternoons by the beach with friends or families. Along the East Coast and Changi beaches, families can be seen swimming, cycling, picnicking and cooking by the barbecue pits. Photographs are usually used to capture good fun times. Many of our contributors&#8217; photos depict the activities enjoyed in the 60s and 70s, like having a dip in the warm water, enjoying the home-made food and playing along the shore. These are actually not far from what modern Singapore families enjoy till this day as well.</p>

<p>Have you ever glide down a long water slide, almost flying horizontally and ending in a big splash in the pool at the bottom? Some of you might remember the huge and colourful slide at Big Splash. The waterpark was built in 1976 and had a 7-storeys water slide consisting 5 separate lanes of different heights. That slide was even visible to drivers along the East Coast Park highway. The owners had revamped Big Splash a number of times, and the slides had ceased operations. Today, <a href="http://www.bigsplash.com.sg/about-me/">Big Splash</a> has transformed into a lifestyle hub, which hosts family-friendly activities and houses several food establishments and shops, continuing to bring families together.</p>

<p>One of the popular spots that appeared in many of the photos contributed at SG Snaps was the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the oldest tropical botanical garden in the Straits Settlement. Families were seen enjoying the serene views, strolling along the lake and feeding the swans. The Swan Lake was given its name because of the swans inhabiting the lake, with the first pair of beautiful mute swans imported from Amsterdam. The photos above shows a black swan (Cygnus atratus). This lake is considered to be the oldest ornamental water feature in Singapore, constructed in 1866. Early this year, in February 2014, the Singapore Botanic Gardens submitted a nomination dossier to the UNESCO World Heritage Board, in hope of receiving Singapore’s first UESCO world heritage site. The decision could be announced in June 2015. It will, perhaps, be an acknowledgement of our rich heritage, a gift of nature, during the nation’s 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary as Singapore comes of age.</p>

<p>Kelongs, shown in the above photo, are a romantic reminder of Singapore’s beginning as a fishing village. Kelongs are wooden platforms built with nibong palms, primarily for fishing purposes although bigger structures serve as houses for families. With a net secured in the centre of the platform, batches of fish would be caught simply by raising the net. Families could enjoy a hearty seafood meal for a weekend dinner. You could even stay overnight at a kelong, fishing with your own fishing line, and sleeping under the stars! During the late 2000s, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) led a reformation to increase the supply of fish for local consumption in the local fish farming industry. Well-educated and young urbanites were drawn to life by the sea. They redeveloped some of the remaining kelongs into fish farms with new knowledge and skills from the AVA. Some of the new kelong owners happily re-named themselves as aqua entrepreneurs and fulfilled their dreams to live by the sea.</p>

<p>The river brings life. Sir Stamford Raffles established Singapore as the first free port in the region, allowing free passage of ships through the Strait of Singapore, thus attracting trade activities between India and China, and the British. Businesses developed around the quay in 1823 and subsequent developments continued up-river along the banks of Clarke Quay, Robertson Quay, and further upstream. Around the 1970s, the river was carrying the debris of the increasing settlers who were living around the water, as well as from businesses and developments around it. Pollution levels could be detected by the whiff of the nose! The government conducted extensive cleaning to restore life to the waters. By the 1980s, the old quayside commercial enterprises gave way to recreational activities such as popular al fresco dining and &#8220;live music&#8221; entertainment. Merging in the scenery of the trading boats of the past, happy paddlers could be seen riding in the colourful paddle boats along the waters teeming with life.</p>
<p>We have captured snapshots of life by the water. Hopefully, it will refresh your memories like the way water refreshes your body on a typical hot and sunny day. When was the last time you played by the water?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The energetic buzz of the Toa Payoh Central was extremely effecting and perfect for the first neighbourhood to kick-start our photo-collection drive at Singapore Snaps. Toa Payoh Central has every conveniences to suit the quintessential middle-class Singaporean lifestyle &#8211; a train station linked to a bus interchange, a cozy public library, and a wide selection of eateries ranging from coffee shops, food kiosks to fast food restaurants and all the ubiquitous food chains. There are also supermarkets, mega-stationery-shop, banks and rows of shops selling clothes, gadgets, services and what-nots.</p>
<p><em>Mdm Sisilia Tan and company posing for a picture by the sculpture found in Toa Payoh Town Park with the estate in the backdrop. Photo: Sisilia Tan</em></p>
<p>Also located here is the headquarters of our nation&#8217;s Housing Development Board (HDB).  Situating the headquarters here is extremely apt for being the first town to be built ground-up by the board in 1968. With a neighbourhood population of close to 116,000 people, it is not a surprise that the town centre will always be crowded with people, especially during the evenings and weekends.</p>
<p>Through chatting with the local residents, we discovered the urban legends and quaint histories of this neighbourhood.</p>
<p><strong>1. Urban legend goes that there was an immutable “Tree God” which fell in a storm in September last year.</strong></p>
<p>Every morning, the SG Snaps team strolled past the site where the “Tree God” used to be &#8211; on the way from the train station to the community library. We were told about the lightning strike that brought down the tree said to be over 100 years old. It is with this curiosity that we searched for the site to pay tributes.</p>
<p>Upon quizzing a few of the shop owners in the vicinity, we were directed to a tightly barricaded site that seemed dilapidated and uncared for. The emptiness of the space was a huge departure from our imagination of the tree with majestic bark and extensive branches that shaded the temple that was beneath it.</p>
<div id="attachment_664" style="width: 339px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Tree-God_National-Archives.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-664" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-664 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Tree-God_National-Archives.jpg" alt="A photo from the 1970s of the sacred tree and its temple at Toa Payoh Central. Photo: National Archives of Singapore" width="329" height="508" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Tree-God_National-Archives.jpg 498w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Tree-God_National-Archives-194x300.jpg 194w" sizes="(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-664" class="wp-caption-text">A photo from the 1970s of the sacred tree and its temple at Toa Payoh Central. Photo: National Archives of Singapore, Source: Singapore Press Holdings</p></div>
<p>The site did exude a mystical charm which was even more resonant when we learned of the strange occurrences when the new town was constructed in 1965: The bulldozers that were tasked to flatten the area malfunctioned when they approached the tree. Workers who tried to fell the tree had also died mysteriously. The town planners then had to alter the layout of the shop houses to accommodate the tree in the centre. Isn&#8217;t it interesting how our urban development can be shaped by mysticism and superstition?</p>
<p><strong>2. Toa Payoh Public Library was one of the earliest full-time library to open after Queenstown.</strong></p>
<p>The location, prior to the opening of the library, was the Games Village which housed athletes for the 7<sup>th</sup> South East Asian Peninsula Games. It was the first regional sporting event ever held in the country in 1973.</p>
<div id="attachment_656" style="width: 485px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Toa-Payoh.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-656" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-656" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Toa-Payoh.jpg" alt="Photo: Chan Lee Shan" width="475" height="674" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Toa-Payoh.jpg 540w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Toa-Payoh-211x300.jpg 211w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-656" class="wp-caption-text">A portrait at the fountain in front of Toa Payoh Community Library. Photo: Chan Lee Shan</p></div>
<p>Before the amphitheatre in the front of the library was built, there was a huge water fountain where many of the residents gathered for photographs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Photo: SG Snaps</p></div>
<p>Toa Payoh Community Library has got to be one of our favourite libraries visited. The library was streaming continuously with visitors over the weekend. Besides being a conducive air-conditioned haven for our tired volunteers to catch their breaths, the library staff there were simply endearing. <a href="/sunny-days-an-offbeat-meeting-at-the-toa-payoh-public-library/">Uncle Sunny</a> is one of them, along with the counter staff who would climb up and down the stairs assisting our requests. Huiyi and Shao, from the Arts and Culture team of the National Library Board, were the ones who made our 3-weeks residence at the library possible. We missed the friendly cleaning aunties whom we grew close to and felt so sorry when we had to leave for another library.</p>
<p><strong>3. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II visited the flats in Toa Payoh twice in 1972 &amp; 2006.</strong></p>
<p>Ask any long-staying resident for a historical anecdote of Toa Payoh and they will definitely mention the visit of Queen Elizabeth II. The lucky then-boy-now-man visited by the Queen in 1972 is Mr Jerome Lim, writer of the blog &#8216;The Long Winding Road&#8217; which reminiscent intimately the personal histories of growing-up in Singapore.</p>
<div id="attachment_666" style="width: 394px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/queen-elizabeth-visits-toa-payoh.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-666" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-666" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/queen-elizabeth-visits-toa-payoh.jpg" alt="Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the rooftop of Toa Payoh's VIP Flat at Blk 53 Lorong 5, during her visit in 1972. Photo: www.toapayoh.com" width="384" height="278" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/queen-elizabeth-visits-toa-payoh.jpg 384w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/queen-elizabeth-visits-toa-payoh-300x217.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-666" class="wp-caption-text">Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the rooftop of Toa Payoh&#8217;s VIP Flat at Blk 53 Lorong 5, during her visit in 1972. Photo: www.toapayoh.com</p></div>
<p>The Queen had visited Mr Lim’s 3-room flat &#8211; a VIP Flat with a rooftop viewing gallery, which sounds like the Pinnacle@Duxton of the 1970s. She returned to the estate 34 years later in 2006 during her Diamond Jubilee tour of the world. There must be a certain nostalgia and pride that our country holds for our history of being colonised.</p>
<p><strong> 4. How can we not possibly mention? The Dragon Playground, of course.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_651" style="width: 529px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dragon_playground.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-651" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-651" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dragon_playground-732x1024.jpg" alt="Photo: Seow Shin Horng" width="519" height="726" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dragon_playground-732x1024.jpg 732w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dragon_playground-214x300.jpg 214w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dragon_playground.jpg 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-651" class="wp-caption-text">Walking along the long &#8216;body&#8217; of the Dragon. Photo: Seow Shin Horng</p></div>
<p>I suppose, most heritage buffs in Singapore would know of the Dragon Playground along Lorong 6. The playground has become so iconic that it has inspired more replicas and reflections than the Merlion in the last 2 years.</p>
<div id="attachment_652" style="width: 567px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pelican_playground.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-652" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-652" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pelican_playground-1024x730.jpg" alt="Photo: Seow Shin Horng" width="557" height="396" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pelican_playground-1024x730.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pelican_playground-300x213.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pelican_playground-1280x913.jpg 1280w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pelican_playground.jpg 1458w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-652" class="wp-caption-text">Digging sand with daddy at the Pelican Playground. Photo: Seow Shin Horng</p></div>
<div id="attachment_650" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dove_playground.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-650" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-650" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dove_playground-730x1024.jpg" alt="Photo: Seow Shin Horng" width="470" height="659" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dove_playground-730x1024.jpg 730w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dove_playground-213x300.jpg 213w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dove_playground.jpg 1046w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-650" class="wp-caption-text">The Dove Playground. Photo: Seow Shin Horng</p></div>
<p>The Dragon Playground was part of a series of animal-inspired playground designed by the HDB in the 1970s. Other motifs include the Pelican, Dove and Elephant etc. In the collection of photographs received from the public, there were many cute kids portraits taken at these playgrounds. It is no doubt that these playgrounds have a prominent place in the childhood memories of Singaporeans who grew up during that era. Though there is another dragon playground in Ang Mo Kio, it is the one in Toa Payoh that retains the sand pit. A sand-filled playground was a common structure in most neighbourhoods, before boring rubber matting replaced the sand. What&#8217;s the fun if you can’t throw sand into the eyes of your enemy/crush ?</p>
<p><strong>5. Toa Payoh used to be a farmland</strong>.</p>
<p>Part of the old Toa Payoh came alive when we spent an afternoon with Mdm Lim Mui Tiang, a resident of Toa Payoh. Mdm Lim recounted where the farms were, and how the HDB flat she&#8217;s living in was previously a hill flattened for the construction of the town. At the age of six, she helped at her family farm with the harvesting of vegetables and feeding of the poultry. By seven, she was bringing water from the well. Though we probably have heard similar stories from the earlier generations many times, it is hard to imagine the same kind of hardship for any children growing up in modern Singapore.</p>
<div id="attachment_667" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ToaPayoh1967.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-667" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-667" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ToaPayoh1967.jpg" alt="ToaPayoh1967" width="480" height="339" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ToaPayoh1967.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ToaPayoh1967-300x211.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-667" class="wp-caption-text">Aerial view of Toa Payoh taken in 1967.

<p>Toa Payoh has come a long way from its earliest histories of being made up of marshland and plantations. The name “Toa Payoh” means “big swamp”  in the Hokkien dialect. Walking down the concrete paths, watching people sip coffee from Starbucks, families pushing their children around in strollers and pedestrians burying their heads in their devices, it must be really astounding to witness such tremendous change within a single lifetime.</p>

Coupled with precise timing, Dark Room Photoshoppers manipulated the conventional film development process and came up with experimental effects that they applied to the negatives of their more daring customers.</p>
<p>Again, I was speaking with Jerome of <a href="http://thelongnwindingroad.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thelongnwindingroad.wordpress.com</a>, picking his brain for insights on these whimsical “frames” printed in the photographs, and we’re guessing that these frames were custom designs and each studio had their own set of designs.</p>
<p>Back in the day, photo studios were not as common as they became in the 1990s. Going to a photo studio was eventful and owning one was a big deal! Photo studios used to brand their studio names and contact details on all the photographs that they developed for customers.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Some times, the way they brand the photographs can actually damage the image. In this example, the pink stamp on the back of the image caused this to happen to the photograph, over time (see below).</p>

<p>These are just some of the examples of amazing trends in photography in Singapore, during the 1960s-70s. I really wish we could find more of these treasures, as they represent a time that no longer exists, in Singapore, and in other countries where digital photography is prevalent.</p>
