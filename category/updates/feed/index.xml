										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thank you so much for your support of the &#8216;Singapore Snaps&#8217; project!</p>
<p>After 3 months of knocking on 2,600 doors in 3 different neighbourhoods, the project scanned a total of 15,239 printed photos after looking through more than 17,000 photos. We made many new friends and heard amazing stories from over 100 participants.</p>
<p>The team will be looking through and categorising all contributed photos over the next several months to select the ones that will be used in the animated films. In the meanwhile, keep a lookout for the many stories that will be published on our website here at <a title="Singapore Snaps" href="http://www.SgSnaps.com/">www.SgSnaps.com</a> and by liking our <a title="Singapore Snaps FB Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/sgsnaps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>&#8216;Singapore Snaps&#8217; is an art project seeking to create 3 animations with collected old photographs contributed by members of the public. The project provided free scanning service at 3 neighbourhood libraries &#8211; Toa Payoh, Bukit Merah and Geylang East, as well as the National Library, from May to July in 2014.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a relational art project with a tag line &#8220;Preserving Precious Memories&#8221;, it is important to us that we keep the element of interaction with the community.</p>
<p>We strive to do this through door-to-door visits with the residents of the neighbouring HDB near the public library, where the team sets up the collection booth. With the involvement of student volunteers, the project connects the residents with students of a younger generation, and engage meaningful conversations about personal histories and memories.</p>
<p>For the past three weeks, we have been collecting photographs from the residents, who we got to know better by talking to them about their memories, of a moment in time of the stories they captured with their photographs. Students from Hwa Chong Institute and Hougang Secondary School, as well as friends who participated in this journey, have been making their rounds together in the Toa Payoh neighbourhood. The photographs and stories they collected are nothing short of intriguing, informing and in fact, unexpected.</p>
<p>Student volunteers arrive in the afternoons after school, or on weekends to visit the neighbourhood either in pairs, or in small groups. Prior to heading out, they are briefed on their introduction of themselves and the project to the residents, and having positive attitudes throughout the visit. Should a resident be interested in learning more about the project, and in the event that the resident wishes to participate, volunteers may be invited into the resident&#8217;s home. While accepting the photo contributions, volunteers are encouraged to be curious and inquisitive so Contributors are encouraged to share their personal stories in relation to the photographs at hand.</p>

<p>When a Contributor submits his or her photographs, we take great care in ensuring that the photographs are kept in its original condition until they are returned. These are the steps that we take:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: We account for all the contributed photographs.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_463" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DSC_0348.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-463" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-463 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DSC_0348.jpg" alt="Singapore Snaps Photo Archival 1" width="580" height="327" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DSC_0348.jpg 3840w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DSC_0348-300x168.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DSC_0348-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DSC_0348-1280x720.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-463" class="wp-caption-text">For each set of photographs collected, we have two types of calculations: 1) Total number of photos submitted 2) Of these, the total number of photos selected for scanning. This way, we ensure full accountability for the photos submitted.</p></div>
<p><strong>Step 2: We protect the photographs and albums with bubble wrap.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_471" style="width: 673px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DSC_0350.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-471" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-471 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DSC_0350.jpg" alt="Singapore Snaps Wrapping" width="663" height="374" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DSC_0350.jpg 3840w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DSC_0350-300x168.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DSC_0350-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DSC_0350-1280x720.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-471" class="wp-caption-text">Loose photographs and photo albums are wrapped in protective bubble wrap before delivering them to our professional scanning studio for digitising.</p></div>
<p><strong>Step 3: We deliver the package personally for scanning. Once scanning completes, the SG Snaps team returns the original photographs and albums to the contributor, together with a free personalised DVD containing the digitised photos.</strong></p>
<p>And that, folks, is what we do on a typical &#8220;workday&#8221; at SG Snaps. We have just finished our stint at the Toa Payoh library and will be at the Central Library and Bukit Merah library from 11 June onwards.</p>
<p>Thinking ahead, we wonder&#8230; how will the photographs collected at Bukit Merah differ from the contributions and stories in Toa Payoh? Will we see a greater variety of photographic types and content, or more similarities? How will our collections in Bukit Merah and Central Library shape the 3 animations? Join our journey, and we shall see!</p>
<p>Till then &#8211; Much Love &amp; Be Well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All life begins with a birth.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I thought it fitting to pick this beautiful image, shortly after birth, to kick start the series of weekly featured photographs. From the thousand plus photographs that we have collected thus far, I noticed a trend in photo taking when a child is born. The arrival of a new being into a family seems to inspire photo taking.</p>
<p>Take a look at your family album, does it also have lots of photos of babies?</p>

<p>It is also common for babies to be naked in their photos!</p>

<p>Weddings, like births, were a common occasion that inspired photo taking. The difference in the type photography of these two occasions is that wedding photos are usually taken in a studio, while babies are usually subjects of more candid and casual photography.</p>
