										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People take photographs for various reasons &#8211; as a way to remember events, as a creative expression, and with the rise in popularity of smartphones, as a form of communication between friends and loved ones. Angela Kuet, with her three siblings, grew up at her father&#8217;s photo studio and to them, photography is family. Her father, Kuet Gin Bok, set up the &#8220;New City Photo Studio (新市影室)&#8221; from 1958 &#8211; 1987. The shop was located at Changi Road 五条半石 which, in Mandarin, means 5 miles and a half from the city centre.</p>
<div id="attachment_1143" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/new_city_photo_studio_web2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1143" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" class="size-large wp-image-1143" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/new_city_photo_studio_web2-1024x776.jpg" alt="The various facades of the studio in the 1960s and 1970s.

Bottom left: Firecrackers were used to celebrate the 9th anniversary of the studio.</p></div>
<p>The busiest time every year at the studio was always immediately after the Chinese New Year celebration, when an increase in photo print requests meant working into the wee hours at the photo studio for the Keuk family. After the doors closed at 9pm, Gin Bok would enter the dark room to develop films and prints. The dark room is perpetually humid. And with chemical solutions and water running continuously, Angela worried for her father&#8217;s rheumatism. His fingers were stained brown from the chemical solutions, which are mixtures of powder formula and water of right proportions. Films and prints are meticulously soaked in these solutions, before running through with clear water.</p>
<p>Angela remembered him to be an extremely hardworking father, who would work long hours to provide for his family of six. Despite his busy schedule, Gin Bok insisted driving the children to their school. There were times when he was delayed in the studio, which meant teary eyes for the children who had to wait patiently at the school gates for their father to fetch them.</p>

<p>Gin Bok voluntarily took photos for the neighbours and friends, including the kacang putih seller, who sells Indian snacks typically made of nuts and spices. He was well-liked by his customers due to his photography skills and eloquence, and thus the studio was the meeting point of friends and relatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Life was simpler,&#8221; said Angela of the good memories growing up at the photo studio. Floods were common and water would overflow into the shop space. The family would prop the equipment up on tables and stilts to keep them dry. Together with her elder sister and two younger brothers, she remembered each day filled with tasks with for the family business, like drying the photos in a giant air dryer and cutting the photo borders away to the correct sizes. The studio closes on Fridays.</p>

<p>Angela says of her childhood growing up with her siblings, &#8220;We were so fortunate that my father used to take us out for activities on Fridays or school holidays. We went swimming at the Changi seaside, visited and took photos at popular sites like the Queen Elizabeth Walk, Botanic Gardens, Fort Canning Hill, National Theatre,Van Kleef Aquarium, Mount Faber and Katong Park. We also visited our maternal grandmother at her coffee shop. Sometimes after the studio closed at 9pm, we would follow my father to send some photos for framing, colouring (for the black and white photos) or to send the clients&#8217; cameras for repair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before digital &#8216;photoshop&#8217;, workers used sharpened lead to edit films and touch up prints using manual techniques. There were also times when newly weds would form long queues outside the photo studio for their wedding portraits to be taken. Photographs were almost always of happy occasions.</p>
<p>After retiring his photo studio business in 1987, Gin Bok turned to chinese calligraphy, a form of art he had been practising in the 1980s. Impressed and awed by his beautiful calligraphy, his studio clients would ask for his work, in forms of festive couplets and even writing requests.</p>

<p>Gin Bok passed away in May 2014. He had left behind a huge collection of diaries which he had been writing continuously over his lifetime. Writings, like photographs, are moments captured of a certain past. In a way, that moment has &#8216;died&#8217; because it does not belong to the present. The act of reading, or looking at these photographs however, transports the viewer back to these times which are considered important to the writer or photographer. For a moment, albeit temporarily, the viewer re-lives in that moment and he/she gained an experience and understanding why that moment in time is so important to the writer/photographer. It might take a while for Angela before she has the courage to read and re-live those diaries her father left behind. When she did, she will realise that they are reminders of how her father talks, moves and thinks. These moments are constantly living and it is an entry to his understanding of the world.</p>
<p>The shop of &#8216;New City Photo Studio&#8217; is currently an eatery specialising in black chicken tonic soup, owned by an old neighbour who knew the Kuet family for a long time while working nearby the shop as a stall assistant. Angela&#8217;s daughter is now a photographer, whose interest started after receiving her grandfather&#8217;s Leica camera on one of her birthdays.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A frail lady in her early thirties peered wearily from behind her door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes? What is the matter?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>We went through the usual drill of introducing the Singapore Snaps Project to her and explained our intentions of collecting old photographs from the public to provide them with free digital copies. At that time, I was with a student volunteer going door-to-door on a photo-collection drive in Toa Payoh, the first neighbourhood to kick-off our art and community program.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get all your photographs back with a DVD of its digital copies within 1 week at your doorstep,&#8221; my student partner chirped.</p>
<p>The lady warmed up to our presence and emerged more confidently from behind her door.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t have any old photographs. My parents didn&#8217;t take any for me. They never cared,&#8221; she said with a straightforward tone. But in her eyes was a tinge of sadness.</p>
<p>Both of us were suddenly thrown off-guard by a gush of empathy. For a short while we did not know what to say. We learned that her name is &#8220;Serene&#8221; and we explained to her that if she is visiting the neighbourhood library where our booth was based, it would be nice to be able to chat again.</p>
<p>Serene thanked us courteously before she closed her door.</p>
<p>Days later, Serene paid a surprise visit to us at our booth. She brought with her an envelope which she held endearingly close to her chest. Sitting together with her on our seventies-fashioned sofa, she revealed three black-and-white photographs and three large colour photographs from the envelope. The black-and-white photographs were of her as a child with her mother, looking very blissful. The large colour photographs were taken in a studio, of Serene in her convocation gown clutching a certificate and looking accomplished.</p>
<div id="attachment_993" style="width: 427px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/010.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-993" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-993" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/010-854x1024.jpg" alt="Photo credit: Jasmine Chan" width="417" height="500" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/010-854x1024.jpg 854w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/11/010-250x300.jpg 250w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/11/010-1280x1533.jpg 1280w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/11/010.jpg 1439w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-993" class="wp-caption-text">Photo credit: Jasmine Chan</p></div>
<p>&#8220;These are the only photographs, I have (of myself) when I was young&#8230; I worked very hard to study and get to where I am now, so that I can live independently and prove myself,&#8221; she told us.</p>
<p>Even though we set a minimum of twenty photographs for a contribution (any lesser will be a toil on the logistics), we accepted her photographs with appreciation. Serene&#8217;s sincerity in supporting our project has certainly moved us. Her situation also made us think about the individuals who never had the luxury of photographs to document their personal histories.</p>
<p>As we met more residents, it turned out that Serene&#8217;s story was not a remote one. Another resident had explained to us how he never had any photographs because his family could not afford a camera. There was also an individual, who told us how he had lost his entire life of photographs because an ex-fiance had burnt all of them in a fit of anger. Having those photographs of their lives documented, would mean everything to these people.</p>
<p>Yet, an absence is a presence of meaning &#8211; that absence of photographs is also a reflection of one&#8217;s personal history.</p>
<div id="attachment_991" style="width: 601px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/285.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-991" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-991" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/285.jpg" alt="Photo credit: Pearl Pang" width="591" height="623" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/285.jpg 591w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/11/285-284x300.jpg 284w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-991" class="wp-caption-text">Photo credit: Pearl Pang</p></div>
<p>On the other side of the coin, we met many generous contributors with cupboards full of photographs waiting to be digitised. We recalled a contributor handing us a huge luggage worth of her family&#8217;s old photographs. We explained to her upfront that there was a limit to what we could accept, but she insisted that we take everything. I still can recall sitting alone in the cold activity room in the top floor of a library, browsing through multiple stacks of photographs from that particular family. Their personal memories whizzed through my head visually. For three hours I went through their photographs, album by album, selecting images that would be valuable to them and the project. While I am certain that these memories are precious to the family, there was also an underlying sense of insignificance of these printed photographs &#8211; like clutter to be cleared.</p>
<p>Whilst some residents whom we met at their homes, readily lent us their photographs for the project, there were others who found their personal memories too precious to be placed in the hands of a stranger. Both ways, we understand and respect their choices. After all, photographs mean different things and have different values to everyone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Going door to door and asking for old printed photographs might be one of the least expected activities for secondary school students of a photography club. Some students might find this activity rather remote from the regular doses of photographing school events and exhibiting their photographs for a school exhibition. What do old photographs from communities have to do with photography then? Possibly everything!</p>
<p>The Singapore Snaps team were delighted to welcome the photography club students of <a href="http://www.fairfieldmethodistsec.moe.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairfield Methodist Secondary School</a> to join us for 3 sessions of their photography club program with the initiation of their insightful teacher-in-charge, Mr Larry Loh.</p>
<p>Kicking off the program in the first week, participating students started off getting to know a little more about the value of old photographs and how to handle them with care. The project orientation session with the students on was held in the cozy activity room at Geylang East Library. The students&#8217; knowledge on photography was wide, but it was one of the first time they had come into close contact with photographs created from the analog era. Some students had even brought their personal family photographs from home to share with the group.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DSC_0058.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-967" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DSC_0058.jpg" alt="DSC_0058" width="705" height="467" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DSC_0058.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DSC_0058-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DSCF69241.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-969" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DSCF69241.jpg" alt="DSCF6924" width="705" height="470" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DSCF69241.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DSCF69241-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px" /></a></p>
<p>Following which, we accompanied the students straight into the neighbouring blocks across the road from the library to begin the door-to-door photo collection. For many of the students it was their first time in a door-to-door community involvement program like this, but all of them certainly had the courage and tenacity. Most of them started out shy whilst a number of the students were very forth coming with introducing the project to the residents.</p>
<div id="attachment_970" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10514670_781495198538088_53123573559908486_n.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-970" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-970" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10514670_781495198538088_53123573559908486_n.jpg" alt="Gracie, the Outreach Officer for Singapore Snaps with two students from FMSS on our first day with the Photography Club." width="800" height="600" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10514670_781495198538088_53123573559908486_n.jpg 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10514670_781495198538088_53123573559908486_n-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10514670_781495198538088_53123573559908486_n-94x70.jpg 94w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10514670_781495198538088_53123573559908486_n-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-970" class="wp-caption-text">Gracie, Outreach Officer for Singapore Snaps with two students from FMSS Photography Club on our first day.</p></div>
<p>On the second session, the students continued going door-to-door speaking to the community. From the feedback session that we had with the students, disappointment from being unable to receive a single photograph from any resident was common:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I felt pretty disappointed as we did not have a single contribution and most of the neighbours turned us down. (On what can be improved) Our communication skills. We need to improve on our mandarin (our mother tongue) and other dialects&#8221; &#8211; Hagen Li</p></blockquote>
<p>The students recognised the value of being multilingual so they can communicate with more people in Singapore because of the diverse cultures here. Comfortable with a single language used amongst their families and friends, the students quickly realised the value of dialects in understanding people from the earlier generations.</p>
<p>But some of the students took the rejection in a very positive light. C.S Chan a student wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Through the collection of old photos and speaking to strangers publicly, I realised that photos are more than just memories. They are precious milestones (of individuals) in their golden years. Many were reluctant to offer (their photographs)&#8230; Perhaps that is how priceless the photos are to them.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Chan also drew the connection between photography and biography in his reflection.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;One&#8217;s photography is another&#8217;s biography.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Audrey, another student from the photography club gave us new insight to our project:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I learned that stories are meant to be shared and the power of voicing our inner thoughts&#8230; This experience allowed me to treasure the community even more especially when there are so many stories waiting to be shared by them! Their fascinating stories bring Singapore&#8217;s past alive, so that us, the next generation could appreciate its beauty and see through its growth.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>We were extremely heartened to receive handwritten reflections like these from the students. They were very honest and we were glad that this community involvement from the students were beyond simply achieving the project&#8217;s goals. The students took home with them new insights about the local community, and of themselves. The younger generation&#8217;s interest and participation are necessary and important for us because the observation and writing of history is a continuous task for us to gain insight of the present.</p>
<p>Singapore Snaps would like to thank the students of the Photography Club from Fairfield Methodist Secondary School and teacher-in-charge Mr Larry Loh. They had travelled far to join us and we have learned as much from them as they had during their journey with us.</p>

<p>Neither of us in the SG Snaps team has had the opportunity to attend a performance at the National Theater of Singapore previously situated on the slope of Fort Canning Park along River Valley Road. Before we were born, or could develop a conscious memory of the world, the theater also known as the &#8220;People&#8217;s Theatre&#8221; was already demolished in the mid-1986. That was when the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) North East line to connect Chinatown to Dhoby Ghaut and the Central Expressway (CTE) began construction and the theatre had to make way for these developments. Our only encounters with this theatre were through the collected photographs and conversations with the contributors, and we certainly saw and felt the glory and splendour the theatre exuded that remained in the hearts of Singaporeans.</p>
<div id="attachment_892" style="width: 747px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/012_4893.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-892" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-892" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/012_4893-737x1024.jpg" alt="The theatre, a common spot for family outings.

Photo credit: Tan Hoon Ngoh Evelyn</p></div>
<p>There were aplenty photographs of people taken in front of the iconic façade of the theatre. Browsing through all the contributed photo albums, it is easy to recognise the five-point exterior, which is emblematic of the five stars on the Singapore flag. The center of the theatre’s outdoor fountain is a crescent moon sculpture representing the crescent moon on our flag. What a brilliant piece of architecture it was, by Singaporean architect Alfred Wong, whose firm won the design competition for the theatre in 1963.</p>

<p>The year the National Theatre of Singapore was constructed was a significant and eventful one for Singapore. 1963 was the year Lee Kuan Yew had declared de-facto independence for Singapore from the British colonial rule, and the year The Malaysia Agreement was signed, combining North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore with the existing Federation of Malaya. These two events placed Singapore amongst the other newly formed independent nations in Southeast Asia.</p>

From the book &#8220;Our Collective Memory&#8221; by Koh Eng Soon.</p></div>
<p>The inaugural show at the National Theatre reflected just that. The Southeast Asian Cultural Festival was launched to celebrate the opening of the theatre on August 8 1963. Eleven Asian countries attended this grand opening, including film stars from Hong Kong. A postage stamp of a value of 5 cents was specially released to commemorate the event. There were performances of folk dances from around the region. In the opening, our first president, Yusof bin Ishak described the festivities as a “South-East Asian cultural renaissance.” It seems that this interest of a bourgeoning cultural scene in South East Asia is not a recent construction but one that has its roots way before our nation’s independence in 1965.</p>
<p>The National Theatre was also the result of one of Singapore’s first major crowd-sourcing project – “A-dollar-a-brick” campaign, in which the public could buy a $1 paper brick, a colour-printed frame showing a design of the National Theatre. This fund-raising campaign supplemented the government for the building costs, and described by the then Minister of Culture, S. Rajaratnam as “a good example of how the success of any effort depends ultimately on the co-operation and dedication of people from all walks of life.&#8221; The theatre also became an emblem of community-building, earning its civic name of the &#8220;People&#8217;s Theatre&#8221;.</p>

<p>The National Theatre of Singapore has its significance beyond its history of being the first and largest theatre in Singapore. Aside from its massive 3,420 seating capacity, it is also a reminder of our beginnings as a nation. As written on the twin heritage site markers by the National Heritage Board on the current site, the theatre signifies “a spirit of self help and nationhood in the early days of nation building.”</p>

<p>Now, close to the original site of the National Theatre of Singapore, stands an artwork by Architectural historian Lai Chee Kien for the Singapore Biennale in 2013. In exactly 50 years since its construction, the sculpture is a reminder of the theatre’s existence, possibly unknown to many Singaporean youths. The 40m-tall painted steel sculpture of the theatre’s façade pales in terms of scale compared to the original size, but it makes an excellent backdrop for photographs as a tribute to the ones taken when the theatre was still around.</p>
<p>There is a situational irony literally behind the sculpture. The vacant space of what used to be the area where cultural celebrations were held is now empty. What is left is but an empty plot of grass with trees meagrely occupying the space. Is this current state of the site a reflection of how our country, in its race for progress, has emptied out any semblance of a true aspiration to culturally define ourselves? Only to be left with an empty shell to remind us of its ghost? Only one can ponder, looking at the smiles of the people in the photographs of the theatre from before.</p>

<p>Singapore Snaps would like to show our great appreciation and admiration to the work of Mr Koh Eng Soon, author of “我们的集体记忆” (Our Collective Memory) – A self-published book, in Mandarin, on the National Theatre of Singapore and several other historical landmarks. Mr Koh had visited us at the Singapore Snaps booth at the National Library building on July 27 2014. That afternoon, he had shared with us all the wonderful histories of the theatre. In the book, he shares his valuable collection of photographs and paraphernalia of the theatre through its lifetime and his personal memories of it. We salute Mr Koh for his love for civic history and his generousity. This article will not be possible without him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>6 months ago, since the day we had received our first photo contribution, it has been nothing but hard work for everyone in the SG Snaps team. Going through the thousands of beautiful memories that we have collected from our trusting contributors now brings us wonderful experiences from our collection drive. We cannnot say this any less: All the photographs that we have collected will not be possible without the efforts of the participating students who have stepped up to go door to door in the neighbourhoods with us.</p>
<p>For this blog entry, we recollect one of the best days with a group of 12 volunteers joining us at Redhill. The participating volunteers were the staff of the <a href="http://www.halogen.sg/">Halogen Foundation</a>, teamed together with students from CHIJ St Theresa&#8217;s Convent and Hwa Chong Institution. It was daunting, thinking how to coordinate 6 pairs of volunteers scattered in the neighbourhood, but we knew one thing for sure &#8211; that each of their participation will be unique with every resident they meet.</p>
<p>The volunteer experience at Singapore Snaps means a lot to us. We believe, for an individual who shares our vision and comes forward to work with us, every precious minute of their time counts. The best returns of volunteering will always be the learning and interaction in a social sphere where the public gathers to do good. Because of that, before we head out to the neighbourhoods to interact with the local residents, a warming-up briefing session with our volunteer team would be the key to a rewarding volunteer experience.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_03.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-814" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_01.jpg" alt="Khee Shi Hui_01" width="898" height="600" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_01.jpg 898w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_01-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 898px) 100vw, 898px" /></a></p>
<p>Each volunteer gets to introduce himself or herself in the quirkiest of ways &#8211; by recounting his or her first memory; the first thing you remember consciously. This is SG Snaps&#8217; unique way in getting to know everyone better. This part of the session is always filled with comical moments that even the shyest volunteer would join the conversation and have a good laugh.</p>
<p>Simply because SG Snaps is one project which is interested in excavating memories, being acquainted with our volunteers means learning their memories too. First memories are significant to us, because it is intimate and it signifies the beginning of our consciousness as an individual. We also had the honour of some volunteers bringing their own photo albums to share with the group. Looking through old photographs is one definite way of knowing a person better.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_05.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-818" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_05.jpg" alt="Khee Shi Hui_05" width="401" height="600" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_05.jpg 401w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_05-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /></a></p>
<p>Most certainly, the most important aspect of our briefing session is appreciating and handling the old photographs. We prepare our volunteers to receive the photographs in an array of formats &#8211; from the ones pasted into adhesive albums, to the ones inserted in sleeves or even piled up in loose sheets. SG Snaps team member and photographer Samantha Tio, shared with the student volunteers the technicalities of handling photographic prints. She also shared her views on why images created during the era of analog cameras are important and relevant to us even today.</p>

<p>The students started out with great energies, and with positive attitudes they had managed to encounter some amazing finds. During this particular door-to-door collection drive in Redhill, we found our first hand-coloured photographs. For many of the young participants, it was the first time seeing anything like that. <a href="/excavating-the-modern-studio-portrait-in-singapore/">Read more about studio portrait trends from the 1950s-80s in our previous post.</a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_11.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-822" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_11.jpg" alt="Khee Shi Hui_11" width="898" height="600" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_11.jpg 898w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_11-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 898px) 100vw, 898px" /></a></p>
<p>What was also remarkable about that photograph was the handwritten message on the back in Chinese characters in calligraphic style, dating and addressing the portrait to a beloved. The photograph was taken and developed in 1967, and was addressed to the sender&#8217;s aunt. We later noticed more photographs with such personal messages. It was a trend then, to give a copy of the photo with accompanying text to relatives and friends, just like a postcard.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_12.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-823" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_12.jpg" alt="Khee Shi Hui_12" width="401" height="600" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_12.jpg 401w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_12-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /></a></p>
<p>One of our youngest volunteer, Edison recounts how he was so delighted when an elderly resident had invited his group into his house. He described the house to be filled with incredible antiques and the series of portraits that he had kindly contributed for the project seemed to be dated to the early 20th century.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_12.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-820" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_07.jpg" alt="Khee Shi Hui_07" width="898" height="600" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_07.jpg 898w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Khee-Shi-Hui_07-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 898px) 100vw, 898px" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately not all the students managed to interest a resident to participate and contribute old photographs. Rejection is part of this learning process and it pushes us beyond of our comfort zones, humbling and motivating us continuously. We truly hope our volunteering students had learned beyond the textbooks, and benefited from their unconventional afternoon with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sgsnaps">Singapore Snaps</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With so many wonderful studio portraits within our photo-collection, this genre of image-making in our cultural history definitely deserves our observation and survey.</p>
<p>To start, I was skype-chatting with a long-time friend, Daphne Ang, who was recently at the NUS Museum doing a research fellowship on portrait studios in Singapore from the late 19<sup>th</sup> to early 20<sup>th</sup> century. I had sadly missed the city tour that she had conducted here, but I was fortunate to chat with her remotely in London where she is pursuing her PhD in an extension of her research on the early commissioned portraits. Daphne also has a project called &#8220;<a title="Portrait of the Straits" href="http://portraitsofthestraits.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Portraits of the Straits</a>&#8221; that is very close to what SG Snaps aspires to unveil, but with a more scholarly angle. Together, Daphne and I had taken a look at some of the studio photographs from the SG Snaps collection and it turned out that majority of the images were dated beyond the 1940s into the 1990s, outside the scope of her research. So she psyched me up in investigate the photographs from post-independence era, in hope that I could conceivably create a chronological continuity for the studio portraits throughout the history of Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>1. Studios moved from the city into the neighborhoods through the early to the late 20th century.</strong></p>
<p>In Daphne&#8217;s research of the early photography studios, she wrote about how the pioneer studios ran by European photographers were first located at the heart of commerce &#8211; along High Street, Stamford Road and North Bridge Road. However in the 1890s, Chinese-operated photography studios began to flourish in the Chinese quarters of the city, like Koon Sun Photo Studio along South Bridge Road.</p>
<div style="width: 389px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/watermark/picas_data/tn_pcd/20080000359-7141-D210-2313/img0289.jpg" alt="" width="379" height="491" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Koon Sun Photographer at 179 South Bridge Road in the early 20th century.

<p>We found out, from the addresses printed on studio portraits collected by SG Snaps, that after the 1950s, locations of new photo studios had spread further out into the neighborhoods with the establishments of new towns in Singapore. It is common for the studios to be at the ground floor of public housing buildings, like the one in the image below.</p>
<div style="width: 483px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/watermark/picas_data/tn_pcd/19990007471-0004-3012-0920/img014.jpg" alt="" width="473" height="311" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Bride, groom, best man and bridesmaid pose outside a photo studio in the 1980s. Photo: National Archives of Singapore, Source: Ronni Pinsler</p></div>
<p>Understanding how the earliest studio portraits were commissioned by the more affluent community and thinking of photographs as tokens of identity, could this movement of photo studios into the neighborhoods signify the desire of a growing middle class to create representations of themselves?</p>
<p><strong>2. The props and backgrounds evolved to reflect the times.</strong></p>
<p>Early studio portraits were very elaborate in dressing the set and the sitters. In the Chinese tradition of portrait-making, photographs were composed quite similarly to the paintings.  The level of intent placed in picturing the sitter and his/her status was so careful, to the extent that adornments signifying status will be drawn on its absence.</p>
<div id="attachment_694" style="width: 270px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/BM_014-00647b.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-694" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-694" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/BM_014-00647b-495x1024.jpeg" alt="Early portrait of a Chinese matriarch (possibly not taken in Singapore) with jade bangles and ring drawn onto the print.

<div id="attachment_689" style="width: 271px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/012_04893.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-689" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-689" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/012_04893-666x1024.jpg" alt="A studio portrait of a Chinese lady with a gold necklaces and jade pendant drawn on to the photographic print.

Photo: Evelyn Tan</p></div>
<p>Though commissioned studio portraits had evolved to be less decorative and simpler over the years, the props used reflected its current trend.</p>
<div id="attachment_691" style="width: 422px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/0067.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-691" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-691" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/0067-804x1024.jpg" alt="Two ladies having fun during a shooting session with an electric guitar and microphone.

Photo: Lim Poh Kwuan</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_690" style="width: 422px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/0055.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-690" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-690" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/0055.jpg" alt="A lady posing with a radio and telephone.

Photo: Seow Shin Horng</p></div>
<p>Props and backgrounds aside, the fashion of the times makes too for a standout statement.</p>
<div id="attachment_693" style="width: 376px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/222_15695.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-693" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-693" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/222_15695-763x1024.jpg" alt="Photo: Mabel Sim" width="366" height="489" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-693" class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Mabel Sim</p></div>
<p><strong>3. The advent of the air-conditioner.</strong></p>
<p>In hot and humid Singapore, it became an important consideration for the customers whether a photo studio has air-conditioning, or not. Who would want to be sweating at the once-in-a-lifetime photo session? Thus, many photo-studios emphasised and promoted their air-conditioned studios at the corner of their prints to win over customers and to keep up with competition.</p>
<div id="attachment_687" style="width: 411px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/BM_014-00647c.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-687" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-687" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/BM_014-00647c-659x1024.jpeg" alt="Wedding couple in a studio with an air-condition system called the &quot;Coolit&quot;. Photo: Lee Fook Weng" width="401" height="622" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/BM_014-00647c-659x1024.jpeg 659w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/BM_014-00647c-193x300.jpeg 193w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/BM_014-00647c-1280x1987.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-687" class="wp-caption-text">Wedding couple in a studio with an air-condition system called the &#8220;Cool-lit&#8221;. Photo: Lee Fook Weng</p></div>
<p>With the growing popularity of western gowns and suits for wedding portraits, an air-conditioned studio were more ideal and popular for photographs compared to the sweltering heat of the outdoors.</p>
<div id="attachment_688" style="width: 413px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/698_00404e.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-688" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-688" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/698_00404e-865x1024.jpg" alt="A portrait made at the Golden Studio that has air-condition facilities.

Photo: Lee Ah Dah</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Transitioning from black-and-white to coloured prints.</strong></p>
<p>During the days of black-and-white photography, colours envisioned by the photographers were colored by hand onto either the glass plate of the negative or onto the print itself.</p>
<div id="attachment_686" style="width: 283px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/BM_014-00647a.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-686" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-686" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/BM_014-00647a.jpeg" alt="Hand-colored portrait. Photo: Lee Fook Weng" width="273" height="377" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-686" class="wp-caption-text">Hand-coloured portrait. Photo: Lee Fook Weng</p></div>
<div id="attachment_684" style="width: 284px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/376_12112a.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-684" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-684" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/376_12112a-650x1024.jpg" alt="Hand-colored photograph of a boy. Photo: Wong Meng" width="274" height="431" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/376_12112a-650x1024.jpg 650w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/376_12112a-190x300.jpg 190w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/09/376_12112a-1280x2013.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-684" class="wp-caption-text">Hand-coloured photograph of a boy. Photo: Wong Meng</p></div>
<p>In the 1970s, colour photography became available and made a swift entrance into the output of photo-studios in Singapore. The demand for colour images was high. Towards the 1980s, the black-and-white photographs were only reserved for passport photos. According to Mr. Ang Mong Kee, a photo-studio owner along Henderson Road in the 1980s, it was common for photo studios to bring color negatives to an external lab as the color-photo developing machines were too expensive for small independent studios. The black-and-white photographs were, however, processed on-site at the studio.</p>
<div id="attachment_683" style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/073_10609b.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-683" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-683" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/073_10609b-731x1024.jpg" alt="Color photo of a family. Photo Lim Mui Tiang" width="315" height="439" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-683" class="wp-caption-text">Color photo of a family. Photo Lim Mui Tiang</p></div>
<p>Looking through the photographs during our collection drive, many contributors agreed with us that the quality of black-and-white photographs endure the test of time better than the coloured ones. We found many of the colour photographs, though newer than the black-and-white&#8217;s, had entered into advance stages of deterioration. Like in the photo above, the strongest pigment left behind is the red, resulting in a pinkish tint to the photograph.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Understanding the procedures of analog photography has definitely allowed me to appreciate better the level of workmanship gone into mastering the craft of studio portraits. It is extremely challenging to make a good studio shot, and I have developed a new level of respect for our pioneer photographers. In regards to the photographs collected to be emblems of aspirations of a community in that era, they have given us much insight into how identity continues to be shaped in the way we present our own image as tokens of history.</p>

<p>“Dark Room Photoshoppers”, as we shall call them, worked with actual film negatives and chemicals. Coupled with precise timing, Dark Room Photoshoppers manipulated the conventional film development process and came up with experimental effects that they applied to the negatives of their more daring customers.</p>
<p>Again, I was speaking with Jerome of <a href="http://thelongnwindingroad.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thelongnwindingroad.wordpress.com</a>, picking his brain for insights on these whimsical “frames” printed in the photographs, and we’re guessing that these frames were custom designs and each studio had their own set of designs.</p>
<p>Back in the day, photo studios were not as common as they became in the 1990s. Going to a photo studio was eventful and owning one was a big deal! Photo studios used to brand their studio names and contact details on all the photographs that they developed for customers.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Some times, the way they brand the photographs can actually damage the image. In this example, the pink stamp on the back of the image caused this to happen to the photograph, over time (see below).</p>

<p>These are just some of the examples of amazing trends in photography in Singapore, during the 1960s-70s. I really wish we could find more of these treasures, as they represent a time that no longer exists, in Singapore, and in other countries where digital photography is prevalent.</p>
<p>If you have a photograph like this at home, please share them with us by telling us your story and any bits of history that the image inspires. You can do so by posting a as a comment, or emailing to us at we@SgSnaps.com</p>

<p>With that in mind, I thought it fitting to pick this beautiful image, shortly after birth, to kick start the series of weekly featured photographs. From the thousand plus photographs that we have collected thus far, I noticed a trend in photo taking when a child is born. The arrival of a new being into a family seems to inspire photo taking.</p>
<p>Take a look at your family album, does it also have lots of photos of babies?</p>
<div id="attachment_389" style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Singapore-snaps-8_small.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-389" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-389     " src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Singapore-snaps-8_small.jpg" alt="Credits to Ms Rebecca Fong" width="625" height="412" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Singapore-snaps-8_small.jpg 3570w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Singapore-snaps-8_small-300x197.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Singapore-snaps-8_small-1024x675.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Singapore-snaps-8_small-1280x844.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-389" class="wp-caption-text">Credits to Ms Rebecca Fong</p></div>
<p>It is also common for babies to be naked in their photos!</p>

<p>The cabinet in the background of this photo looks like the cabinet that we have at the Toa Payoh booth! Are we seeing a trend in the design of cabinets from the past? I wonder which time period we can this design is from?</p>
<p>Also, check out the old sewing machine behind the boy, these days, such machines are being restored and dismantled where by the “legs” of the machine are used as legs for a new table. Do you still have a similar type sewing machine at home?</p>

<p>Weddings, like births, were a common occasion that inspired photo taking. The difference in the type photography of these two occasions is that wedding photos are usually taken in a studio, while babies are usually subjects of more candid and casual photography.</p>
